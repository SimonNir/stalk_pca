# Surrogate Theory Accelerated Line-search Kit (STALK)

**Note!** *This is NOT the official release but rather an experimental version to play around with
incorporating automatic parameterization and transition pathway functionalities.

For a well-tested implementation of the automated transition pathway workflow, please refer to https://github.com/SimonNir/legacy_surrogate_hessian_pca_workflow.git
*

Surrogate Theory Accelerated Line-search Kit (STALK) is a Python implementation of The
Surrogate Hessian Accelerated Parallel Line-search method. The method is intended for
optimizing and performing energy minimization of atomic structures in the presence of
statistical noise.

**Note!** *The repository was renamed 'surrogate_hessian_relax'->'stalk' on 19 Dec 2025, and
the code usage has changed substantially upon python packaging. To complete projects in the
old code base, keep using [v0.1](https://github.com/QMCPACK/stalk/releases/tag/v0.1) or
reach out for help in migration. We regret any inconvenience and anticipate fewer breaking
changes in the future.*
